Project Description
•	Purpose: User can find local venues and use BandsInTown to see who’s playing in the next two weeks.  This already exists in BandsInTown itself, but by pulling those artist names and exporting them into a YouTube or Spotify playlist, users will be able to see if they like any upcoming artists they might not have heard of.  Supports local venues and upcoming musicians.
